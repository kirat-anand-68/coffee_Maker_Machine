Coffee Maker Machine ☕️
This is a simple Coffee Maker Machine implemented in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project demonstrates how classes and objects can be used to simulate the functionality of a coffee maker.

Features
Menu Options: Choose from a variety of coffee options.
Resource Management: Tracks the availability of resources like water, milk, and coffee beans.
Transaction Handling: Simulates the cost of coffee and accepts payments.
User Interaction: Allows users to input choices and interact with the machine.
Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:

main.py: The entry point of the program where the coffee machine is instantiated and run.
coffee_maker.py: Contains the CoffeeMaker class that manages resources and brewing logic.
menu.py: Contains the Menu and MenuItem classes, defining coffee options and their properties.
money_machine.py: Handles transactions and money management.
Future Improvements
Add more coffee recipes and menu options.
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
Introduce a refill system for resources.
